            <p>Instructions</p>
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325F (160C) and line a 12-count muffin tin with paper liners. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium-sized bowl stir together graham cracker crumbs and 1 ½ Tablespoons sugar. Add melted butter and stir again until ingredients are moistened and completely combined.</li>
            <li>Portion about 2-3 teaspoons of the crust mixture into each liner in your prepared muffin tin. Use a spoon or the (clean) bottom of a ¼ cup measuring cup to tamp down crumbs so they are evenly packed into the bottom of each liner. Set aside while you prepare your mini cheesecake filling.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="color: royalblue;">
            <p>Cheesecake</p>
        </h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Place cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl and use an electric mixer) and stir on low speed until smooth and creamy (don’t whip the cream cheese or excessively beat it, you don’t want to incorporate too much air into the batter).</li>
            <li>Add sugar and stir again until well-combined.</li>
            <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir until ingredients are well-combined, pausing occasionally to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl so there are no lumps.</li>
            <li>Gradually add eggs, one at a time, until just incorporated. Keep the mixer on low-speed and do not over-beat. Once again scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and stir on low-speed once more to ensure ingredients are completely combined.</li>
            <li>Evenly divide batter into muffin tin liners (I like to use an ice cream scoop with a lever release to do this, just makes it easy!).</li>
            <li>Transfer to 325F (160C) oven and bake for 17-20 minutes or until edges are just beginning to turn a very light golden brown and centers are set. Do not over-bake or the texture will be dry and mealy.</li>
            <li>Allow cheesecakes to cool completely to room temperature and then gently remove each mini cheesecake from muffin tin. Transfer to refrigerator and chill completely (about 2-3 hours) before serving.</li>
            <li>If desired, top with whipped cream, strawberry sauce, blueberry sauce, or chocolate ganache!</li>
        </ol>
