            <p>In this article, we describe various web-related concepts: web pages, websites, web servers, and search engines. These terms are often confused by newcomers to the web or are incorrectly used. Let's learn what they each mean!</p>
            <h2>
                Summary
            </h2>
            <p>As with any area of knowledge, the web comes with a lot of jargon. Don't worry. We won't overwhelm you with all of it (we have a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary">glossary</a> if you're curious). However, there are a few basic terms you need to understand at the outset since you'll hear these expressions all the time as you read on. It's easy to mix these terms since they refer to related but different functionalities. You'll sometimes see these terms misused in news reports and elsewhere, so getting them mixed up is understandable.</p>
            <p>We'll cover these terms and technologies in more detail as we explore further, but these quick definitions will be a great start for you: </p>
            <p><strong>web page</strong></p>
            <p>      A document which can be displayed in a web browser such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari. These are also often called just "pages."     </p>
            <p><strong>website</strong></p>
            <p>A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "website" or a "site." </p>

            <p>A web page is a simple document displayable by a browser. Such documents are written in the HTML language (which we look into in more detail in other articles). A web page can embed a variety of different types of resources such as: </p>
